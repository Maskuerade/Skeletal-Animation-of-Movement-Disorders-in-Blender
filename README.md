# Skeletal Character Animation Project

## Overview

This project utilizes **Blender** to create and animate a skeletal character, simulating both normal and disordered human movements. 

## Features

- **Character Design**: A textured and clothed skeletal character for enhanced realism.
- **Animations**: 
  - Common healthy movements.
  - Clinical animations depicting various movement disorders.
- **Virtual Environment**: 
  - A realistic room setting with appropriate lighting and objects to enrich the visual experience.

## Purpose

This project aims to bridge **3D animation**, **medical simulation**, and **computer graphics**, providing a tool for better understanding movement disorders in a visually engaging manner.

## Methodology

### 1. Character Modeling & Animation
- **Skeletal Animation**: A character was created in Blender and animated to simulate both healthy and disordered movements.
- **Movement Disorders Simulation**: Motion patterns characteristic of Parkinson's Disease and Huntington's Disease were animated.
  
### 2. Environment Modeling
- A **gymnastic environment** was designed to act as a contextual backdrop for the animated character.
- Various **lighting sources** and material textures were applied to enhance realism.
  
### 3. Integration with Blender
- After completing the animations, the character was imported into a Blender-rendered virtual room with textures and lighting setups that contribute to the overall atmosphere.

## Types of Disorders Simulated

### Parkinson's Disease (Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia)
- **Motor Characteristics**: Bradykinesia, tremors, rigidity.
- **Movement Simulation**: Involuntary, hyperkinetic movements during long-term medication usage.

### Huntington's Disease
- **Motor Characteristics**: Rapid, jerky movements (chorea).
- **Movement Simulation**: Involuntary, hyperkinetic movements representative of the disorder's progression.

## Results
The project successfully replicated human locomotion and movement disorders through skeletal animation, providing a visually accurate representation for educational and diagnostic use. The integration of lighting, textures, and a realistic environment further enhanced the realism of the simulations.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of 3D animation and medical simulation in visualizing movement disorders. Future iterations can expand on additional disorders, refine animation techniques, and enhance the virtual environments for more immersive educational tools.
